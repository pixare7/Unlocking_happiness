## Project Description

In the rapidly changing work landscape following the pandemic, companies globally are facing new challenges around employee morale, productivity, and overall well-being. This project aims to analyze how various work settings and personal factors impact employees' life satisfaction and overall well-being, providing data-driven insights for organizations seeking to foster a more productive and positive work environment.

Leveraging a range of machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, supervised and unsupervised learning, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we aim to identify patterns and relationships among factors such as stress levels, sleep quality, access to mental health resources, physical activity, social isolation, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. Each of these techniques provides unique insights: supervised learning models, like Decision Trees and Random Forests, allow us to predict life satisfaction and identify the most influential factors, while unsupervised learning and PCA help uncover hidden patterns within the data, grouping employees with similar experiences and highlighting key areas where work conditions impact well-being.

Our approach aims to produce actionable insights that highlight critical areas where companies can focus to enhance employee satisfaction, productivity, and overall motivation. By understanding the factors that significantly influence well-being, organizations can develop strategies to improve workplace culture, support mental health, and drive productivity.

This project not only serves as a resource for businesses but also contributes to the broader conversation on work-life balance and employee well-being in the post-pandemic era. The combination of robust data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques ensures that the findings are both comprehensive and grounded in modern analytical methods, making them valuable for strategic decision-making in today's evolving work environment.

## Resources

The following dataset was used for this analysis:

  - [Remote Work and Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health) 

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the dataset used in this analysis may contain synthetic data. Synthetic data is artificially generated, often designed to resemble real-world data patterns without originating from actual individuals or events. While synthetic datasets can provide valuable insights and maintain privacy, they may not fully capture the complexities and nuances found in authentic data.

Analyses and insights derived from synthetic data should be interpreted with caution, as certain trends, correlations, or relationships may not hold in real-world applications. When applying these findings to real-world scenarios, further validation using authentic data is recommended to ensure accuracy and reliability.

We advise stakeholders to consider this limitation when drawing conclusions or making data-driven decisions based on this analysis.

## Machine Learning Models

Machine learning models are computer programs created to recognize patterns in data and make predictions. These models are developed using machine learning algorithms, trained on data that may be labeled, unlabeled, or a mix of both. For this project, two primary types of machine learning models are used: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. Below is an example illustrating how a machine learning model works.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. This means the data comes with correct answers or outcomes, allowing the model to find patterns and make accurate predictions. For example, if we want a model to recognize job satisfaction levels, we provide data with known satisfaction ratings so the model can learn and predict satisfaction for new data accurately.
