## Project Description

In today’s rapidly evolving work landscape, especially post-pandemic, companies worldwide are encountering new challenges related to employee morale, productivity, and overall well-being. This project seeks to analyze how various work settings and personal factors contribute to employees' life satisfaction and well-being, offering data-driven insights that organizations can use to create a more supportive and productive work environment.

The analysis incorporates a comprehensive dataset that includes key variables influencing individual well-being, such as stress levels, sleep quality, access to mental health resources, physical activity, social isolation, work-life balance, and job satisfaction. While happiness is a multifaceted concept influenced by many factors, this project focuses specifically on workplace conditions to uncover patterns that might explain why certain countries, like Iceland, Denmark, and Sweden, consistently rank among the highest in overall happiness.

To achieve these insights, a range of machine learning techniques—including Decision Trees, Random Forests, supervised and unsupervised learning, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)—is employed. Supervised models like Decision Trees and Random Forests allow for the prediction of life satisfaction and identification of the most impactful factors, while unsupervised learning and PCA reveal hidden patterns and groupings within the data. These methods highlight key areas where work-related factors influence well-being and allow for a deeper understanding of the links between workplace conditions and overall happiness.

By generating actionable insights, this project aims to equip organizations with strategies to enhance employee satisfaction, well-being, and motivation. Beyond serving as a practical resource for businesses, this analysis also contributes to the broader discourse on work-life balance and employee happiness in the modern workplace. The combination of thorough data analysis and advanced machine learning techniques ensures that these findings are both comprehensive and rooted in robust analytical methods, making them valuable for decision-making in today’s dynamic work environment.

## Objective

This project aims to address the question, "How do working conditions impact employee well-being and life satisfaction in countries with higher happiness ratings?" To answer this, the analysis will delve into related sub-questions to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing employee satisfaction.

1. Does work location (remote, hybrid, on-site), serve as a positive driving force towards increasing people’s well being and life satisfaction?  

2. Can machine learning help us understand which variables have the highest impact to a greater quality of life?


By exploring these questions, we aim to deepen our understanding of the factors that influence individual happiness and uncover new strategies to enhance overall quality of life.

## Resources

The following dataset was used for this analysis:

### Remote Work & Mental Health

The [Remote Work and Mental Health](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)  dataset on Kaggle offers insights into how remote work influences mental well-being. It includes data on stress levels, work-life balance, and productivity among remote workers.


> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the dataset used in this analysis may contain synthetic data. Synthetic data is artificially generated, often designed to resemble real-world data patterns without originating from actual individuals or events. While synthetic datasets can provide valuable insights and maintain privacy, they may not fully capture the complexities and nuances found in authentic data. Analyses and insights derived from synthetic data should be interpreted with caution, as certain trends, correlations, or relationships may not hold in real-world applications. When applying these findings to real-world scenarios, further validation using authentic data is recommended to ensure accuracy and reliability. We advise stakeholders to consider this limitation when drawing conclusions or making data-driven decisions based on this analysis.

### Our World In Data
The [Happiness and Life Satisfaction](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction) Data provides a comprehensive analysis of global well-being, focusing on self-reported measures of happiness and life satisfaction. It explores variations across countries and over time, examining factors such as income, health, and social support that influence subjective well-being.

## Where Are All The Happy People At?



## Looking At The Bigger Picture
Our curiosity was sparked by identifying the top-ranking countries in terms of happiness, leading us to explore the potential factors contributing to higher levels of well-being in these nations. To investigate, we developed a Tableau dashboard focused on four key factors that may impact happiness in various work settings: sleep quality, stress levels, feelings of isolation, and mental health ratings. Through analyzing these metrics, we aim to gain data-driven insights into how work environments shape overall well-being, providing a comprehensive overview before conducting a deeper analysis of these specific factors.


## Machine Learning Models

Machine learning models are computer programs created to recognize patterns in data and make predictions. These models are developed using machine learning algorithms, trained on data that may be labeled, unlabeled, or a mix of both. For this project, two primary types of machine learning models are used: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. Below is an example illustrating how a machine learning model works.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. This means the data comes with correct answers or outcomes, allowing the model to find patterns and make accurate predictions. For example, if we want a model to recognize job satisfaction levels, we provide data with known satisfaction ratings so the model can learn and predict satisfaction for new data accurately.
